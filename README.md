This webapp is a contacts management tool, implemented using React/JavaScript, that allows user to store information about their friends including names, emails and phone numbers. I completed this project to become more proficient with React before moving on to building more complex applications. In the process, I was able to get a better grasp on understanding the main concepts including EcmaScript 6, state, props, callback functions, and seperation of concerns.
